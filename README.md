# Ruby Monopoly #

This is a Ruby implementation of Monopoly. The goal is to complete it fully adherent to the official rules.

### Bugs ###

* Doubles isn't resulting in another turn for the current player

### Not implemented ###

* Rolling doubles while in jail doesn't get you out of jail
* No functionality to get out of jail when paying $50
* Chance and Community Chest lands aren't simulating any card pull or reaction
* No ability to purchase houses/hotels or mortgage properties

### Nice to haves ###

* A user can't buy houses or hotels if they have no monopolies. Adjust the message prompt to exclude the option if the user has no monopolies

* Add graphics and UI
